Course Description
------------------

Art 195 is an in-depth study focusing on contemporary topics in art and related subject matter. This course is for the procurement of the undergraduate BFA in Art degree. Within this course, the student will develop individual approaches, methodologies, and practices in the creation of art. This course will culminate in a final group show demonstrating professional competence in the students’ area of concentration. Participation in the final exhibition with the approval of the student's advisory committee is required. Prerequisite: 30 units of upper division art, admission to the BFA program and ART 198, or ART 210 with advisor's approval.

This course offers the opportunity for individual exploration in the student’s area of interest, including deep investigation of specific topics and processes in a single semester long project. The course will build into a final public group presentation of the work and is the final graduation requirement for the BFA Degree.

The development of the final project and installation will be supplemented with readings, group discussions, one on one meetings with faculty and guest presentations. Students in this class are responsible for the planning, organization, and execution of the final exhibition. Open dialog, critique, and discussion are vital to the student’s success in this class. The final work can be executed in any medium, including print, video, animation, writing/publishing, web, or installation.

All corresponding press materials and final documentation will need to be divided up into small teams of students. The final installation should look professional and well polished. Students will also need to build and maintain a website for documentation of their final projects.
