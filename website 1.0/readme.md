Hey Everyone! 
Make sure to download the Dimensions file and use the html page titled "KiraBoyer.html" as a template to create your project page. Then just upload your "FirstnameLastname.html" to the github so I can add it in to the final website build. To make this easier, file-path-wise, make an additional file for your referenced images or videos titled "img_FirstName" and upload that to the github. In total, you will upload your html page and an images file to the github. For example, I would upload KiraBoyer.html and img_Kira. 

Hope that is easy to follow!
-Kira
