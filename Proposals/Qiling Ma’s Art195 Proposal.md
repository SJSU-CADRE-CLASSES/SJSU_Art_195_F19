# Qiling Ma's Art195 Proposal

My idea for my project is about the exploration of self-identity. As an immigrant from China to the U.S, I have accept both eastern culture and western culture. The culture conflicts have big influence on me about how I view myself and my perception to the world. I want to create an projection mapping installation to show my self-identity exploration process.


# Application about my project

I want to create a projection mapping on a Phenakistiscope or a 3D zoetrope. The reason why I want to combine phenakistiscope/zoetrope and projection mapping instead of only using projection mapping is that I think phenakistiscope/zoetrope always present the motion of objects repeat and repeat again. They are doing the same thing all the time. I want to use phenakistiscope/zoetrope as a metaphor to represent my life journey is constantly seeking for something. And the projection mapping can show different things I have met in my self-identity explorating journey. I have two plans about it. 
### Plan 1 - Projection Mapping + [Phenakisticope](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phenakistiscope)

  - Make a glass disc and carve a sequence image to represent me 
  - Use arduino to make the disc constantly spinning
  - Use projection mapping video project on the transparent Phenakisticope (the image will go through the disc and project on the wall and combined the animation on the Phenakisticope. )


### Plan 2 - Projection Mapping + [Zoetrope  ](https://laughingsquid.com/spinning-animated-sculptures-by-gregory-barsamian/)
(inspired by Artist Gregory Barsamian’s wonderful cylindrical sculptures)
  - Printing 3D models and use wood to make a cylindrical zoetrope 
  - Use arduino to make the cylindrical zoetrope constantly spinning
  - Use projection mapping video project on the cylindrical zoetrope
