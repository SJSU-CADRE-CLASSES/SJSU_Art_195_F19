Homebound

	For my BFA project I want to create an interactive game that explores the concept of “coming of age.” Titled, “Homebound,” I want to use pixel art to create a narrative scene that will touch upon the enduring journey of life. Everybody goes through the same process. You grow up and you have to eventually leave your home in order to find explore the world and find your place. In order to discover new things, you have to leave old ones behind. This project in a way, represents my personal journey from childhood into college. Although I am separated from my friends and family at my hometown, I can always make the “jump” to go visit them. In my prototype for Homebound, I created a scene that depicts two cliffs in front of a lone moon and mountains in the horizon. The cliffs are meant to represent that although you are apart from your original home, it is still close at heart. I wanted to capture the feeling of relaxing loneliness in this demo screen. For continuing on with this idea, I was thinking about creating different scenes that sum up to create a journey. Throughout the journey the player will gain and lose things along the way. I’m still debating whether or not to make it into a full-fledged game or to keep it as a compilation of digital pixel paintings.
