# BFA Proposal: *Self-Reflection*

### Proposal Summary

Self-Reflection is an immersive exhibition intended to be a commentary on society’s behavior and how we perceive ourselves as individuals or as a group of people. With the rising popularity of social media and rapidly advancing technology, the idea of the ‘self,’ the ‘individual,’ and ‘society’ has become distorted and morphed into an array of judgmental and opinionated views on ourselves as well as others. Whether it be negative or positive, this exhibition forces us to become aware of our own bodies as well as our perception of those around us. 

### Research

Personally, I like to explore how the body interacts with an environment and what kind of dialogue it creates with the objects around it. Evolving from a digital space to the physical, I came across the idea of mirrors. Mirrors have always had a dominant factor in our lives consistently present in our bathrooms, living rooms, bedrooms, and hallways. We use them to look at ourselves, our flaws, our imperfections, or to boost our self-confidence and give praise. Many artists have used mirrors in their exhibitions such as Christian Larsen’s Mobile Mirrors, Yayoi Kusama’s infamous Infinity Mirrors Exhibition, and Jeppe Hein’s Mirror Wall and Mirror Labyrinth NY. 
  
### How it Works

Several one way/two way mirrors will be layered and fixed together to create a giant wall. The wall itself will be curved so that it may stand on its own:the side curving inward will be reflective (mirrored) and the outside being see-through. Two lights will be focused on the viewer when approaching the mirror side, one from the front and one the back, while the rest of the room will be left dim. When a person stands in front of the reflective side, he/she will see him/herself reflected back while those walking around to the other side can look straight through the mirrors at the person on the other side. 
  
### Questions/Next Steps

Considering the cost of the project, it may become very expensive. An alternative is to make the mirrors myself by purchasing clear acrylic sheet and mirror film separately. I will also have to consider the installation process and how I will create this wall. In addition, should there be a use of sound or use silence as part of the piece?
