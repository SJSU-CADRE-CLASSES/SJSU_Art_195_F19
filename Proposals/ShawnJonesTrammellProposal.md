# Yuansu Panlong Gun: Elemental Dragon Staff
Yuansu Panlong Gun is the legendary weapon of my Dungeons & Dragons Burning Soul monk, Asura Culainn. Consisting of three different magical weapons: the booming sansetsukon, Shandian, pulsing with magical lightning energy, the frigid quarterstaff, Bing, made of black true-ice that never melts, and the flaming nunchucks, Huo, erupting with dragon fire. This work displays each form in their own light and glory. Pulsing with energy of ancient elemental dragon of  Ice, Lightning, and Fire, the Yuansu Panlong Gun waits for arrival of the ardent monk.
