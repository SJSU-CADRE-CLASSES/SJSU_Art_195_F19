<b>SUMMARY PROPOSAL:</b><br>
<i>Wanderove</i><br>
2019<br>
Custom Electronics and shoes<br><br>
 
My latest project, Wanderove is an interactive sculpture that brings to life a normal pair of shoes through the use of robotics. I plan to convert a pair of shoes into ones that have the capability to detect the distance of objects and physically reacting accordingly. 
<br><br>
The shoes will have a flight to distance sensor on the heel which will communicate a distance to two servo wheels through an arduino and causing the shoes to roll left or right at different speeds, depending on the distance.  
<br><br>
The shoes coming to life is a metaphor for those of us who have gone through life questioning our chosen path and turning new directions pursuing something or someone we love. 
<br><br>
Wanderove will be displayed on a 3X6X1 platform placed in the center of the gallery, so to cause the sensor to detect as much action as possible and have enough room for them to roam around. 
<br><br>
I am excited to evolve an older robotics project and evolve it to create Wanderove. I feel that many people have gone though questionable moments in their life and would relate to what the shoes are walking through.
