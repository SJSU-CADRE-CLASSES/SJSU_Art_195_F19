<b>SUMMARY PROPOSAL:</b><br>
<i>Wanderove</i><br>

My latest project, <i>Wanderove</i> is an interactive sculpture that brings to life a normal pair of shoes through the use of robotics. I plan to convert a pair of shoes into ones that have the capability to detect the distance of objects and physically react accordingly. 
<br><br>
The shoes will have a flight to distance sensor on the heel which will communicate a distance to two servo wheels through an arduino and causing the shoes to roll left or right at different speeds, depending on the detected distance.  
<br><br>
The shoes turning left and right aimlessly is a metaphor for those of us who have gone through life questioning our chosen paths and turning new directions, pursuing something or someone we love. 
<br><br>
<i>Wanderove</i>  will be displayed on a 3X6X1 platform placed in the center of the gallery, so to cause the sensor to detect as much action as possible and have enough room for them to roam around. 
<br><br>
I am excited to evolve an older robotics project and evolve it to create <i>Wanderove</i> . I feel that many people have gone though questionable moments in their life and would relate to what the shoes are walking through.

<b>MATERIALS NEEDED:</b><br>
-My robots 5X5X3.5 <br>
-A pair of shoes <br>
-3X6X1 ft platform <br>

Many of us have gone through life questioning our chosen path and turning new directions, pursuing something or someone we love. Some of us  search for romance, a career, a location, an emotion, a memory; we have all longed or long for something we believe will give us happiness; oblivious that while we are on the search, we are turning our backs on something else that might have had the answer all along. <br><br>

I have longed to find a career that I truly love. It has taken trial and error and I find myself back to square one, I’ve gone a full circle. I am only one out of the 80% of college students who turn to a new major. I am only one of the countless adults who quit their careers to go find one that bring them happiness. The great philosopher <i>Immanuel Kant (1724-1804)</i> said the rules for happiness is having “something to do, someone to love, something to hope for.'' <i>Wanderove</i> represents my journey to happiness.
