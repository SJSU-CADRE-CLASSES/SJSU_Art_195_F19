For my piece, I plan to use a projector displaying an animated video and a device that projects a light onto a wall/surface which
measures the viewer's proximity to the device and changes the projected light's color gradually from green to red based on how close
the viewer is to the device. 

+The idea for the video is to have different symbols relating to contamination/OCD rituals that represent the struggle I've gone through
for the last 6 years. These symbols will be modeled in Maya, and either spin or dance across the screen, almost like a commercial advertising
these products/rituals as a way to show that just like in advertising, you can't turn them off, they exist wether you want to see them or not.
I want to model cleaning products like bleach and lysol, as well as hands washing themselves and possibly an animation representing contamination
in the mind of one who suffers from OCD, possibly something such as a living, parasitic surface. 

+The light-projecting device I am planning on making out of wood or plastic, in a rectangular box in order to hide the light source. I am also
planning on possibly 3D printing something that could cover the box that reperesents something like a contaminated surface, or a visually
displeasing surface to reflect and reinforce the idea of not only conntamination, but the fear of touching or coming into contact with the
box and surface. The light emitted would also reinforce the idea of the feeling of getting closer when it changes from green (representing 
calm) to red (representing danger). The device would be built with an Arduino and coding, connected to a strip of LEDs and a light driver board.
