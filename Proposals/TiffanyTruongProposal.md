# BFA Show Proposal

For my BFA project, I want to create an interactive installation reflecting how memories fade over an amount of time. It will be a version of a paper theatre with motors (and possibly a light sensor) attached to it so that pieces will move over time.

**Background/Inspiration:**

I came up with this idea when thinking about what I've done this past year. When trying to pull from my experiences this year to come up with a project during a discussion with my friend, he pointed out that I was only pointing out big, happy events while failing to mention bad events. I realized that my mind was pushing retaining certain memories while conveniently forgetting about others. I decided to make a piece that showed the visualization of how fleeting and selective memories can become.

**Idea:**

My idea for this is to take inspiration from paper theatres and create my own version of a paper theatre with my own memories of a certain period of my life. I plan to create a blown up sized paper theatre with certain objects stuck to the corners and other free floating ones from my memories with motors, and possibly a light sensor, attached. The motors will be attached to the free floating objects so that they move; the goal of those is that as the show goes on, the objects would slowly move out of frame and hide behind the walls (thus showing how we forget memories over time). As for the light sensor, I would install it in the front of the piece and program it so that viwers could shine their phone flashlights towards it and have it move the motors attached to the objects. When the light is shone, some objects would move more towards the center while some kind of linger around the edges. This would be to show how when we focus and think back on times, we don't remember it all right away. So, if I do this right, the finished project will be a paper theatre with moving pieces that will slowly back into the edges as the show goes on (thus fading from memory) as well as posisbly having a light sensor that will draw certain objects towards and away from the center (to kind of show how our minds sort memories when we try to focus in on them).
