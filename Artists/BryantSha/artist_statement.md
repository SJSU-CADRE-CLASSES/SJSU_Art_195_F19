*Red, Yellow, Green?* is a collage of heavily exaggerated found footage meant to immerse the viewer through color deficient eyes. 1 in 12 men are born with it while a measly 1 in 200 women are born with it. I myself suffer from mostly from red-green and blue-yellow. Although it rarely becomes severe enough to hinder day-to-day life, traffic lights are something I suffer from the most. Depending on time of day and distance, the lights can become indistinguishable. Its very hard to notice but if someone makes a comment about not being able to see colors as vividly as you, they're most likely colorblind.
