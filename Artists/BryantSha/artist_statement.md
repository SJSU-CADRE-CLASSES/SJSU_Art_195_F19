*Monochromatic* is a collage of heavily edited found footage meant to immerse the viewer through color deficient eyes. It is a visual
disorder that cannot be cured through conventional means but usually is not severe enough to hinder everyday life. As a colorblind myself,
are the changes to color channels intentional? Or are they the result of someone who can't see certain colors communicating in a spectrum
only they would understand.
