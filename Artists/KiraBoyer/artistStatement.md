  Kira Boyer is a digital media artist from the San Francisco bay area. Inspired by society and her experiences as she traverses through life, she uses digital software, sculptural techniques, drawing techniques, and conceptual processes to create her work. She intends to refer to the past to inform the present. 
  No stranger to anxiety, Kira's work, Scoptophobia, addresses privacy in the digital age in the context of people's daily interactions with, or proximity to, their smart devices. Society surround themselves with technology and grant devices permission to exist as extensions of self within private and public spaces. These devices are always watching, in a way, whether they are tracking locations, being granted access to  cameras and photos, collecting and selling personal data, etc. In this installation, the audience looking through the keyholes act as the voyeuristic cameras of devices looking into someone's personal world.
