Self-Reflection is an immersive exhibition featuring two-way mirrors constructed into curved wall that acts as a commentary on society’s behavior in how we perceive ourselves as individuals and as a community. Increasing popularity of social media and rapid advancements in technology has led to distorted ideas of the “self,” the “individual,” and “society” where these terms have morphed into an array of judgmental and opinionated views of ourselves and each other. Whether it be negative or positive, this exhibition forces us to become aware of our own bodies as well as our perception of those around us.
