Language has evolved rapidly over the past few years. Each new generation has acquired their own way of speech which is constantly being updated into an unofficial dictionary. The increase use of mobile devices and social media led to the development of new lingo, acronyms, and emojis.

Unfiltered features a Twitter bot attempting to speak "millennial." It retweets random terms from Urban Dictionary's API or use its examples to fit into today's generation.
