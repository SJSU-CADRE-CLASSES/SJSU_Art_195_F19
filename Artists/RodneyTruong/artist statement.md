Planet penguin is a 2D Platform Shooter that reverses the role of the human and penguins. As humans we are responsible for being the greatest threat to penguins due to our waste, overfishing and development. The game has the player struggling to survive and fight back against the greater that is the penguin race. By placing the player in the position of the prey I hope to raise environmental and wildlife awareness. I've always found videogames to be the most immersive form of digital media and felt that it was appropriate for establishing the vision I had for this show.
