*Reverb*, 2019

audio and video

How much do we actually know about ourselves? Do we actually know ourselves best or do other people know us better?

Reverb is a piece about introspection and the various voices that we might hear in our minds. These voices might come from ourselves, from people we have met, or just figments of our imagination. These voices can be loud, and at other times, just barely whispers. These voices can be demeaning and critical, and on ocassion, encouraging. These voices can be overwhelming, and it might seem like no matter how hard we try, we can not shut them out. But if we actually manage to, the voices will return after a short repsite of silence.

The voices echo and reverberate inside our skulls. 
We are our own worst critics, but also the strongest motivators.
