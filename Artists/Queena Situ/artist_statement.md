How much do we actually know about ourselves? Do we actually know ourselves best or do other people know us better? 

What kinds of things do we say to ourselves when we escape into our own minds and self-reflect? Are we self-critical? Encouraging? Self-deprecating? Judgemental? Maybe our minds wander and we delve into memories of our past. Introspection is something that we all do in silence, and something that we do not typically express aloud. Sometimes we prefer to be with ourselves and try to get to know ourselves better, but we all have implicit biases and subjective opinions, whether they be about ourselves, other people, or subjects aside from ourselves. Our thoughts are aways with us, and we are always speaking to ourselves, having our own personal conversations. 

We are our own worst critics.
