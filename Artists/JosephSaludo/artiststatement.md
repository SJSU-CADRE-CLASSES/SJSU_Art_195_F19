My artwork is about the anticipation that people expect are going to happen in a situation. I constructed a set of visual scenes that produces an expected outcome within a situation but is taken away from the clear outcome of the scene. Even though the scenes have no significant relationship with each other, I focused on the aspects each subject have about the feeling of building anticipation and never getting the feeling of satisfaction from seeing the end result of the scene. In this project I aimed to try and explore different types of results that people might expect.
